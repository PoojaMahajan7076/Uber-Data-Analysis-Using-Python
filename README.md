# Uber-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover patterns in ride demand, peak hours, and fare distribution. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I explored key insights that can help improve Uber's operations and pricing strategies.
# Uber Data Analysis 🚖  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes Uber ride data to understand ride trends, peak hours, and fare distribution using Python.  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- 🚗 Uber rides increase during **rush hours and weekends**.  
- 📍 Certain locations have **higher ride demand**.  
- ⏳ **Traffic and time of day** affect fare prices.

📊 Visual Explorations in the Analysis
This project includes various visualizations to understand ride trends:
1️⃣ Unique Values: What are the unique values in categorical columns?
2️⃣ Category & Purpose Distribution: How are rides distributed across different categories and purposes?
3️⃣ Time Analysis: How do rides vary across different times of the day?
4️⃣ Category vs. Purpose: What is the relationship between ride categories and purposes?
5️⃣ Numerical Correlation: What is the correlation between numerical features?
6️⃣ Monthly Trend: How do rides vary across months?
7️⃣ Day-wise Trend: How do rides vary across days of the week?
8️⃣ Distance Distribution: How are ride distances distributed (MILES)?
9️⃣ Short Distance Analysis: How does ride distance vary for values less than 100 miles?
🔟 Detailed Distance Analysis: What is the ride distribution for distances under 40 miles?
